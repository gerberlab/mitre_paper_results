Rule list cluster 99: posterior probability 0.000756
Representative rule list:
Rule list with 4 rules (overall likelihood -6.29):
If NO rules apply: positive outcome probability 0.999 (0.874 -- 1) (log-odds: 6.62 (1.94 -- 11.4))

Rule 0 (predicted positive outcome probability if only this rule is satisfied, 0.984 (0.157 -- 1)):
	 Odds of positive outcome DECREASE (log-odds change by -2.49 (-8.3 -- 3.81)), if:
		Between time 512.000 and time 900.000, variable sq13;size=1127644; average is below 0.0344
This rule applies to 95/113 (0.841) subjects in dataset, 22/95 with positive outcomes (0.232).

Rule 1 (predicted positive outcome probability if only this rule is satisfied, 0.894 (0.113 -- 0.999)):
	 Odds of positive outcome DECREASE (log-odds change by -4.48 (-8.68 -- 0.0539)), if:
		Between time 27.000 and time 415.000, variable sq24;size=579437; average is below 0.0023
This rule applies to 79/113 (0.699) subjects in dataset, 20/79 with positive outcomes (0.253).

Rule 2 (predicted positive outcome probability if only this rule is satisfied, 1.81e-06 (1.32e-08 -- 2.29e-05)):
	 Odds of positive outcome DECREASE (log-odds change by -19.8 (-24.8 -- -17.3)), if:
		Between time 221.000 and time 609.000, variable 13204 average is below 0.0113
This rule applies to 99/113 (0.876) subjects in dataset, 21/99 with positive outcomes (0.212).

Rule 3 (predicted positive outcome probability if only this rule is satisfied, 1 (1 -- 1)):
	 Odds of positive outcome INCREASE (log-odds change by 25.2 (22.5 -- 29.6)), if:
		Between time 27.000 and time 415.000, variable 14676 average is above 0.0272
This rule applies to 24/113 (0.212) subjects in dataset, 24/24 with positive outcomes (1.000).
