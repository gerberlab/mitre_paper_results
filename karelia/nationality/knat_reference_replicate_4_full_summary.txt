	 Odds of positive outcome INCREASE (log-odds change by 13.8 (7.89 -- 19.8)), if:
		Between time 415.000 and time 803.000, variable sq563;size=5038; average is above 0.0000
		Between time 318.000 and time 706.000, variable 8218 average is below 0.0184
This rule applies to 28/113 (0.248) subjects in dataset, 16/28 with positive outcomes (0.571).

Rule 2 (predicted positive outcome probability if only this rule is satisfied, 8.45e-05 (5.11e-07 -- 0.181)):
	 Odds of positive outcome DECREASE (log-odds change by -22.4 (-27.5 -- -14.6)), if:
		Between time 27.000 and time 415.000, variable 14676 average is below 0.0282
This rule applies to 90/113 (0.796) subjects in dataset, 7/90 with positive outcomes (0.078).

Accuracy of representative rule:
AUC: 1.000
