BAYES FACTOR FOR THE EMPTY RULE SET: 0


POINT SUMMARY:
Rule list with 1 rules (overall likelihood -0.00242):
If NO rules apply: positive outcome probability 1 (1 -- 1) (log-odds: 10.6 (8.97 -- 11.3))

Rule 0 (predicted positive outcome probability if only this rule is satisfied, 2.78e-05 (1.35e-07 -- 0.000266)):
	 Odds of positive outcome DECREASE (log-odds change by -21.1 (-26.4 -- -18.9)), if:
		Between time 27.000 and time 415.000, variable 14676 average is below 0.0256
		Between time 27.000 and time 415.000, variable 13223 slope is below 0.0003
		Between time 512.000 and time 900.000, variable 12619 average is below 0.2374
This rule applies to 66/90 (0.733) subjects in dataset, 0/66 with positive outcomes (0.000).
